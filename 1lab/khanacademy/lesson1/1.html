    <p>Future. The despotic state annually organizes demonstration survival games, which are watched live by the whole world. The lot to participate in the Games falls to the young Katniss and Pete, who is secretly in love with her. They have known each other since childhood, but now they must become enemies. After all, according to the inviolable law of the Hunger Games, only one of the 24 participants can win. The judges don't care who wins, the main thing is the spectacle.

    <p>Are you,are you coming to the tree <br>
    Where they strung up a man they say who murdred three<br>
    Strange things did happen here<br>
    No stranger would it be<br>
    If we met up at midnight int the hanging tree</p>
